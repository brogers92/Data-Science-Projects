ABOUT ME

Hello World, my name is Bryan, and I am a graduating student in Data Science program from Bellevue University and a new member of the data science community.
I am interested in learning about new opportunies and projects within the community.
Outside of data science, my hobbies involve running, cycling, disc golf, pickleball and generally being outside. I have run 2 marathons ans look to run many more.
I am hoping to build upon my Python and R skills post graduation, and looking forward to using my degree to open up many new doors and possibilites within data science. 




WORK/PROJECTS

https://github.com/brogers92/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main 

This portfolio inlcudes a variety of projects uisng Python, R, and Tableau with topics ranging from data cleaning and preperation, data vizualization, to EDA and data analysis
covering predicitve analytics and other projects, and machine learning and model creation such as linear regression models in both R and Python.

LIST AND SUMMARY OF PROJECTS

Classification Models and Clustering

A Sentiment Analysis Model to classify movie reviews as positive or negitive ratings based on text and a logistic regression model.

Credit Card Fraud Detection with Data Mining

This project aims to develop a model for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using data mining techniques. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. By analyzing historical transaction data, models can be built to detect fraudulent activity in real-time, minimizing financial losses.

Customer Churn Predictive Analytics

This project aims to predict customer churn for Netflix using data science techniques and develop strategies to retain valuable subscribers. Customer churn is a significant challenge for subscription services like Netflix. By predicting which users are at risk of canceling their subscriptions, Netflix can implement targeted retention strategies.

Data Preperation

A collection of EDA code for prepping data for MLB Statistics Project.

Line and Step Charts demonstrated in R

A collection of code and graphs of line and step charts represented by R.

Linear Models in R

Using R and R Studio to demonstrate Linear regression models.

Regression Models in Python

An assignment showcasing Python to create regression models to analyze pregancies.

Predicting Major League Baseball Game Outcomes with Machine Learning

This project proposes a machine learning approach to accurately predict Major League Baseball (MLB) game winners. By analyzing historical data and utilizing advanced algorithms, the model can potentially provide valuable insights for fans, analysts, and teams.

Optimizing Running Performance through Data Analysis

The goal of this project to perform analysis and come up with results based on proven data to empower runners to train smarter, not harder. By providing data-driven insights into their training, the analysis and data can help runners identify areas for improvement, set realistic goals, and achieve their full potential.

Unveiling Movie Magic with IMDB Data

By applying data science techniques to IMDb data, this project unveils valuable insights into the factors influencing movie reception. These findings can empower filmmakers, streaming services, and ultimately, enhance the moviegoing experience for audiences.

Rogers530Week8.inypb (Hypothesis Testing and Linear Least Squares)

Using Python and Jupyter Notebook to showcase hypothesis testing and Linear Least Squares using BRFSS data to determine tests for heights and weights of responders.
