ABOUT ME

Hello World, my name is Bryan, and I am a graduating student in Data Science program from Bellevue University and a new member of the data science community.
I am interested in learning about new opportunies and projects within the community.
Outside of data science, my hobbies involve running, cycling, disc golf, pickleball and generally being outside. I have run 2 marathons ans look to run many more.
I am hoping to build upon my Python and R skills post graduation, and looking forward to using my degree to open up many new doors and possibilites within data science.
